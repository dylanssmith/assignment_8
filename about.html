        <h1>Hey, We're Katelyn and Dylan</h1>
        <h4>We’re two friends who met in the Master’s of Human-Computer Interaction Program at Carnegie Mellon. After attending a seminar about ethics, design, and dark patterns lead by Colin Gray, we started thinking a lot about these dark patterns. We started meeting outside of class to do reserach about how we could help everyday people, as well as designers, understand when they’re being tricked by manipulative design.  Also, we wanted people to know a bit on how these patterns manifest themselves in daily life.  After many hours drawing, reading, and scrapping work, we created the current game format!  We drew influences and methods on embedded game design from our Persuasive Deisgn class, taught by Professor Geoff Kaufman.</h4>
